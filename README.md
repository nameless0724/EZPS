Hi there! Welcome to Easy Payslip or EZPS.

EZPS is a prototype webapp that plans to help every employee have an easy access online
on their payslip either on their mobile or their computer. 

Why payslip might you ask? As an employee, it is our right to know how much we earned
through our hardship for the month. It is also our basis of our daily budget for our 
household. However, sad to note that most of our payslip could easily be taken into 
notice since it was mostly given to us a few days after our salary schedule or 
sometime there were no payslip at all. With this concern on hand, EZPS is 
conceptualize.

As the webapp slowly come into realization, initially the features that I have in mind
are the loging in and out of an admin (HR and accounting office staff) and an employee,
viewing of the payslip and summary of the payroll.

I, honestly, have a slow pace development in structurizing this webapp since the knowledge
and experience that give me the basis for this project are through attending the
StackTrek bootcamp as a part-time. I do have zero background in coding, having a full-time
job and plan to have a career-shift soon.

Though this is quite a topsyturvey ride for me, but the risk of learning something new while
meeting other individuals with the same mindset as mine, somehow encourage me to pursue.
